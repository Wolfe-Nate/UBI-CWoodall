  <div id='mission'>
  We have the potential to create a system that allows us to hand the future to our children rather than handing our children a future decided for them.  
    
  </div>

<div className='content-vision-points'>
  <div>
  A transformed society of free individuals who have options, pursue meaningful action, spend more time with their families, express their creative capacities, and give back to society.
</div>
<div>
A fairer and more equitable Germany and world as a result of others emulating the German model of UBI after it has proven successful.
</div>
<div>
Through new methods of political canvassing and by promoting a new narrative around UBI, we will show citizens and leaders alike that this is the detour we must take to prepare ourselves for the future.

Vision: A society guaranteeing every member a periodic payment, enough to enable life in dignity without the necessity to provide anything in return.

A transformed society of free individuals who have options, express their creative capacities, pursue meaningful action, spend more time with their families, and give back to society. 

A fairer and more equitable world as a result of others emulating the German model of UBI after it has proven successful.

Short approach: Through new methods of political canvassing and by promoting a new narrative around UBI, we will show citizens and leaders alike that this is the detour we must take to prepare ourselves for the future and create a more equitable world.
